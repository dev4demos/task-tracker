# Tracker Contracts

All the tracker interfaces are located in this folder


https://jsonapi.org/format/

Interface Design:

A document MUST contain at least one of the following top-level members:
    data: the document’s “primary data”
    errors: an array of error objects
    meta: a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.
The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same document.
